	-- Spawns a Character using SK_None mesh (an invisible mesh)
	local new_char = Character(Vector(0, 0, 0), Rotator(), "NanosWorld::SK_None")

	-- Adjusts the Capsule of this character. For small props it's recommended to use small capsule size
	-- (A capsule is used to handle Character's collision, this will also adjust camera height location)
	-- It's important to adjust the Capsule Size before adding a StaticMesh, as it will be adjusted based on Capsule Size
	new_char:SetCapsuleSize(32, 64)

	-- Attaches a Static Mesh on the character - which will be the Prop it will possess
	new_char:AddStaticMeshAttached("prop", "NanosWorld::SM_WoodenChair")

	-- Disables some functionalities from the Character (picking up stuff, ability to crouch/prone, FPS camera...)
	new_char:SetCanPickupPickables(false)
	new_char:SetCanGrabProps(false)
	new_char:SetCanCrouch(false)
	new_char:SetCameraMode(2) -- Allows only Third Person
